# Factors-that-influence-insurance-premiums

#Overview

This research investigates the factors that influence insurance premiums. The analysis is performed using a dataset containing various features related to individuals, such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, medical history, family medical history, exercise frequency, occupation, and coverage level. The goal is to understand and potentially predict insurance charges based on these factors.

# Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

*   age: Age of the insured individual.
*   gender: Gender of the insured individual (male/female).
*   **bmi:** Body mass index of the insured individual.
*   **children:** Number of children the insured individual has.
*   **smoker:** Smoking status of the insured individual (yes/no).
*   **region:** Region where the insured individual resides (e.g., southeast, northwest).
*   **medical\_history:** Medical history of the insured individual.
*   **family\_medical\_history:** Family medical history of the insured individual.
*   **exercise\_frequency:** How often the insured individual exercises.
*   **occupation:** Occupation of the insured individual.
*   **coverage\_level:** The coverage level of the insurance policy.
*   **charges:** Insurance charges (the target variable).

## Methodology

The research follows these key steps:

1.  **Data Understanding:** Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance. For example, the research creates a `bmi_category` feature based on the `bmi` values.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Converting categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding. This includes features like gender, smoker, region, medical history, family medical history, exercise frequency, occupation, coverage level, and the newly created `bmi_category`.

## Key Findings (Expected)

*   Identification of the most significant factors influencing insurance premiums.
*   Quantification of the impact of each factor on the insurance charges.
*   A predictive model that can estimate insurance premiums based on individual characteristics.

## Usage

The provided notebook (`Factors-that-influence-insurance-premiums.ipynb`) contains the code and analysis performed in this research. To reproduce the results or further explore the data, you can:

1.  Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., JupyterLab, VS Code with Jupyter extension).
2.  Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
3.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to replicate the analysis.

## Potential Further Research

*   Explore different machine-learning models for predicting insurance premiums.
*   Investigate the interaction effects between different factors.
*   Gather additional data to improve the accuracy and robustness of the findings.
